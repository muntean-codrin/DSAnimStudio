## Changes done:
* Added buttons in order to export:
 * a 3D model with its bones in a specific pose
 * animations of a 3D model

The exports are in json format and need to be read and reconstructed by another application
TODO: upload the code for my unity project which reads and rebuilds the 3d models and recreates the animations
